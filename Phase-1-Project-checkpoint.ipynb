    "In an effort to expand its business portfolio, Microsoft is venturing into the movie industry by establishing a new movie studio. However, to navigate this highly competitive industry and maximize their chances of success, Microsoft needs a comprehensive understanding of the types of films that resonate with audiences and perform well at the box office. This project aims to address this knowledge gap by conducting an in-depth analysis of data from various authoritative sources in the movie industry, including Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB, and The Numbers.

    "### b) Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft's lack of knowledge about the current landscape of successful films at the box office presents a significant challenge. Without a clear understanding of which film genres are performing well and resonating with audiences, Microsoft's movie studio is at a disadvantage when it comes to making strategic decisions about the types of films they should produce. This knowledge gap hampers their ability to allocate resources effectively and increases the risk of producing films that may not resonate with audiences or generate significant revenue. Therefore, the primary objective of this project is to analyze the available data from reputable sources and identify the film genres that exhibit strong financial performance. By doing so, Microsoft can make informed choices about the types of films to produce and increase their chances of success in the highly competitive movie industry."
